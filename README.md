# An Introduction to Scientific Coding in Python 3
Welcome to scientific coding! Everything is fine.


## Overview
This short course is targeted at students and scientists looking to improve their scientific programming ability and workflow. It assumes little to no programming experience!

We will cover a range of topics from basic command line navigation and collaborating with version control to creating reproducible scientific analyses with Jupyter notebooks.

If you are *brand new* to programming, you may find an introductory programming course to be a useful supplement. One suggestion is the free, 10 hr [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course at Codecademy. See the [Syllabus](#syllabus) for suggested Codecademy modules to do between lessons.
