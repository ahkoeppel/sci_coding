# An Introduction to Scientific Coding in Python 3
Welcome to scientific coding! Everything is fine.


## Overview
This short course is targeted at students and scientists looking to get starting with scientific programming. It assumes little to no programming experience!

We will cover a range of topics like basic command line navigation, collaboration with version control, basic Python scripting and sharing reproducible code with Jupyter notebooks.

We will also be learning some basic version control. I recommend everyone who has not used Git before to do the short [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) modules to get a basic intro to Git before we apply it in class.

If you brand new to programming or just new to Python, you may find an introductory programming course to be a useful supplement. One suggestion is the free, 10 hr [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course at Codecademy. 

See the [Syllabus](#syllabus) for suggested Codecademy modules to do before each lesson.

The Learn Git course can be found at [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git).

The Learn Python course can be found at [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python).

These are both free courses, but Codecademy will try to get you to pay for extra stuff. You only need to sign up for a free account to do the module. *Don't pay for stuff*!
